## Google Keynote

2 billion active Android devices (smartphone & tablets) today.

Mobile first to **AI first** approach. Deep learning is the base.

Touch, voice and vision are the available inputs to computers.

Image recognition has now a lower vision error rate than humans! Noisy pictures can made clear that humans can reduce their error rate too. Removing objects like fences from pictures is also possible. 

Google Lens is a new product, that can understand what you're looking at and help you take action on it. Example: Point your phone camera on a flower and google lens can tell you what flower it is.

Google builds AI first data centers.

Training and Inference are the two pars of AI. Training is very costful. Google Compute Engine provides for this new Cloud TPUs in its AI first data centers.

For the new AI content has been created [google.ai](https://google.ai/). It provides Research, Tools an Applied AI.

Learning to lean = train neuronal nets with neuronal nets

Other applications for ML with vision and AI can be pathology analysis or DNA Sequencing.

Google translate will have visual translation.

The iPhone has now the Google assistent "ok google". With Google Assistant SDK everyone can integrate "ok google" to its products. If products have it, they will have the label "google assistent build in".

Google Photos has now among others a Photo Book option.

Youtube has now a super chat option. It's a live chat, where you can also donate.

Android O release comes later this summer. In O double tap in text on address, places or similar will select the entire address, place... string.

TensorFlow Lite available for Android.

Vitals in O stand for security enhancements, os optimizations and developer tools: 

- Apps upcomping to playstore are scanned with machine learing based algorithms. To make this more perceptible they created Google Play Protect.
- Twice as fast boot time with O on Pixel
- Play Console Dashboard pins issues on your App to the developer
- Android Studio Profilers allow you to analyze network, memory and cpu in very deep detail and at runtime.
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) will be supported by Android

The beta release of O can be found [here](https://android.com/beta).

Android Go for users with minimal resources. Ex.: Youtube Go, ...

Add Lite variants of you app, they will be highlighted in the play store. Find the guidelines [here](https://developer.google.com/billions).

Daydream is the VR/AR product from Google.

HTC is leader in VR. Lenovo will also be a partner on VR.

GPS can get you to the door. VPS can get you to the exact item that you need for example in a store.

Google Expeditions + AR for learning on schools.

Google will have a job searching feature.
