# Monetization options

- **paid downloads**: Difficult to launch, the user really has to know the value of the app beforehand. Ex.: App for childrens
- **subscription**: Has a long term revenue, but is also difficult to launch.
- **displaying ads**: Is easy to launch, but can cause distraction. Though it seems to be a appropriate way to monetize an app.
- **in-app purchases**: Sell digital goods.

Paid downloads and subscription options can be configured in the playstore for your app.
