Google will train more people to their technologies.

## Ai

**Google Ai** and machine learning is again the focus: on Healthcare (images), on audio, morse code.

**GMail** is redesigned with Ai. Smart tempos: Hit tab for autocompleting. It is rolled out in May 2018.

**Google Fotos** is redesigned with Ai: Share fotos with same person on it, Convert Foto document to pdf, coloring, light changes. Rolled out in the next couple of months.

TPU 3.0 are present and liquid cooled.

**Google Assistant** is reinforced with Google Ai. The goal is to get natural language experience. Continued Conversation, multiple actions and pretty please for polite education are available for Google Assistant soon. Start the assistant with 'Hey Google'.

The Google Assistant launches this summer integrated interactive features like food ordering with partners like Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts. It can also show you a day summary using your calendar and presenting your related information.

Google Assistant comes in navigation in Google Maps this summer.  

The Google Assistant can make real phone calls to reserve a table in a restaurant or make a haircut appointment. Then integrate it in your calendar. It's in the experimental phase.

## Digital Wellbeing

Current FOMO, fear of missing out, should be changed to JOMO, joy of missing out. <a href="https://wellbeing.google/" target="_blank">See new Google Digital Wellbeing site.</a>

**Android Dashboard** will show you, where you spend your time.

**YouTube** has now added take a break reminders and an overview notification of your daily digest.

## Google News Initiative

**Quality journalism** project for the next 3 years. Budget 300 million dollars.

Ai added to **Google News** will bring you the news you care about. The app uses Material theming and **Newscasts**.

Full coverage option allows to compare the news from different sources. It allows a sort of news analysis.

Everyone should get access to the same information.

## Android

Android P is Ai based and partnered with deep mind. The P-goals are

- Intelligence
- Simplicity
- Digital wellbeing

Android P Beta will not be available on Nexus devices. It will be available on Essential Phone, Pixels, Sony Xperia XZ2, Nokia 7 plus,...

### Intelligence

**Adaptive Battery** uses on device machine learning, to adapt the battery to users usage pattern. The results for the moment are 30% reduction in CPU app wakeups.

**Adaptive Brightness** learns how you set the brightness slider and sets it then automatically.

**App Actions** predicts the next action you want to take. Developers need to add an actions.xml to their app, then the action is available on google search, google assistant, play store and smart text selection.

**Slices** are interactive snippets of the app ui. They can be shown by the google assistant. It's a new API. Example: Type 'Lyft' to google search and see their slice.

**ML Kit** is a free set of machine learning APIs. It is based on TensorFlow Lite and cross platform (iOS and Android).

### Simplicity

New system navigation: Single clean **home button**: swipe up, to see open apps and 5 predicted apps, swipe up again, to see all the apps. Slide the home button left and right to scroll through your open apps. Search bar at the bottom.

Smart **text selection** available also from open apps (the overview).

**Audio volume** adjusts automatically. Only care about on, off, silent.

When blocked app rotation is on, rotation option is now displayed on the bottom bar.

**More Simplicities**: notification, profiles, settings, screenshot, crash dialogs, status bar

### Well being

**Dashboard**, **App Timer**.

**Do Not Disturb mode** stated by gesture 'Shush': turn your phone screen to the bottom and the phone will change to DND-mode.

**Wind down mode**: Set a sleep time and the colors of your phone will be set to gray scale.

## Google Maps

Different Types of vehicles (motorcycle added). Ai added.

New Tab **'For you'** to see what is around your location. It uses machine learning to find your matches.

Long press on a place adds it to a **shortlist**. You can share or save the list. You can vote in real-time on locations within a team.

## Google Lens

Camera VR Feature on google maps navigation. Called **VPS**.

Google Lens will be integrated in the camera app for the phones compatible with Android P. For ex.: Google Lens Smart Text recognition allows you to copy and paste text from a photo.

## Waymo

Waymo, the self-driving car from Google, will be callable via his own app.

Waymo has multiple sensor systems: a vision system, a lidar system and a radar system.

The number of developers using Android Studio tripled in the last 2 years.

1. [New Android Capabilities](#new-android-capabilities)
1. [Platforms and Tools](#platforms-and-tools)

## New Android Capabilities

Android **Slices** are coming with templates.

Android Assistant Actions: Create Action Links, Action notifications or Routine Suggestions.

PWA (Progressive Web Apps). Lighthouse Version 3.0 is launched.

More clear design guidances for Material Design. **Material Theming** makes Material Design more dynamic.

Material Components are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/material-components).

Cloud Text-To-Speech is available. More in MLKit.

Firebase Predictions feature available thanks to machine learning (ML Kit).

## Platforms and Tools

Kotlin will be the language of choice for the long term. Already 35% of pro developers are using Kotlin. So, **learn** more **Kotlin**!

Installing **APK sizes** are now reduced by **dynamic delivery**. Use APK Analyzer to see if your app will profit from dynamic delivery. Choose 'Android App Bundle' when generating your APK to have dynamic delivery. Find the results in the Google Play console under **App bundle explorer**.

**Google Play Instant**:  Try a game without having to install it first.

**Android Jetpack** is a set of libraries and tools. Android Jetpack is designed for Kotlin. AndroidStudio now integrates a [**navigation editor**](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation/navigation-implementing).

Emulator is now starting close to instant.

Linux apps run on Chrome OS now.
