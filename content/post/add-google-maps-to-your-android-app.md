# Play services

To use them add to the build.gradle:

```compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:10.2.1'```

Then add to the Manifest:

```
<meta-data 
	android:name="com.google.gms.version"
	android:value="@integer/google_play_services_version"/>
<uses-permission
	android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

Create GoogleApiClient in ```onCreate()```

Connect GoogleApiClient in ```onStart()``` to Location Service (or other relevant API)

Overwrite ```onConnectionFailed()``` and ```onConnectionSuspend()``` in Location Service

Write ```onConnected()``` and create a LocationRequest that queries the Location Service

Write ```onLocationChanged()``` and get the Location object which you can then use

# Maps

Generate a SHA 1 Key from the terminal by typing:
```
cd ~/.android

keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
```

Go to developers console. Create a project. Activate Maps API. Generate an API Key for Andorid App and enter your SHA 1 and packagename.

## Maps fragment
Create an xml fragment with
```
android:name="com.google.android.gms.maps.MapFragment"
```

Set attributes on the map fragment:

```
xmlns:map="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
map:cameraBearing="112.5"
map:cameraTargetLat="40.7484"
map:cameraTargetLng="-73.9857"
map:cameraTilt="65"
map:cameraZoom="17"
```
